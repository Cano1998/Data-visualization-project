# Data-visualization-project
A project focused on data visualization to explore various aspects of a car dataset. The visualizations provide insights into car performance, efficiency, and characteristics based on different manufacturers and features.

The goal of this project is to create informative and visually appealing plots that highlight key relationships and trends in the car dataset. The visualizations include:

A boxplot to identify which manufacturers have the cars with the highest revolutions per mile.

A histogram to compare fuel efficiency between city driving and highway driving.

A line plot to examine the relationship between wheelbase and turning circle.

A bar plot to show the correlation between car size and horsepower.



The dataset includes various features related to car specifications and performance, such as:

Manufacturer

Revs per mile

Fuel efficiency (city and highway)

Wheelbase

Turning circle

Car size

Horsepower

# Visualizations
## Boxplot: Manufacturers with the Highest Revs per Mile
This boxplot shows the distribution of revolutions per mile across different car manufacturers, highlighting which manufacturers have the cars with the highest revs per mile.

## Histogram: Fuel Efficiency (City vs. Highway)
This histogram compares fuel efficiency in city driving versus highway driving, helping to identify which type of driving is generally more fuel efficient.

## Line Plot: Relationship Between Wheelbase and Turning Circle
This line plot visualizes the relationship between a car's wheelbase and its turning circle, illustrating how these two variables are related.

## Bar Plot: Car Size vs. Horsepower
This bar plot demonstrates the correlation between car size and horsepower, showing that larger cars tend to have more horsepower.
